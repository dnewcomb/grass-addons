## DESCRIPTION

*i.vi* calculates vegetation indices based on biophysical parameters.

- RVI: ratio vegetation index:
- NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
- IPVI: Infrared Percentage Vegetation Index
- DVI: Difference Vegetation Index
- PVI: Perpendicular Vegetation Index
- WDVI: Weighted Difference Vegetation Index
- SAVI: Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index
- GARI: Green atmospherically resistant vegetation index
- MSAVI: Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index
- MSAVI2: second Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index
- GEMI: Global Environmental Monitoring Index
- ARVI: atmospherically resistant vegetation indices
- GVI: Green Vegetation Index

## Description

NDVI

- Data Type Band Numbers (\[IR, Red\])
- TM Bands= \[4,3\]
- MSS Bands = \[7, 5\]
- AVHRR Bands = \[2, 1\]
- SPOT XS Bands = \[3, 2\]
- AVIRIS Bands = \[51, 29\]
- example: (AVHRR) NDVI = (channel 2 - channel 1) / (channel 2 +
    channel 1)
