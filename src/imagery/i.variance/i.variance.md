## DESCRIPTION

Following the Woodcock and Strahler (1987), *i.variance* resamples a
raster *input* layer (normally a remotely sensed image) to successively
decreasing resolutions and calculates the mean local variance of the
entire image at each resolution. Local variance is defined as the
variance in a 3x3 window.

The modules starts at the current computing region resolution and then
decreases the resolution (increases the pixel size) by *step* until it
reaches the maximum size of pixels (aka minimum resolution) determined
by the *max\_size* parameter, or when the number of total pixels falls
below *min\_cells*. If both are given, *min\_cells* takes precedence.

Resampling to lower resolution uses the average of higher resolution
pixels.

By default, the module prints a comma separated list to stdout
containing each resolution that represents a local maximum of variance
(higher variance than the resolution before and after in the iterations)
as well as the difference in variance with the neighbor with most
similar variance.

In addition, the user can choose to output the results in the form of a
graph plotting variance against resolution (*plot\_output*) either to a
file by giving a file name (its extension determines the output format)
or to the screen using '-'. The entire data of variance depending on
resolution can also be saved in a csv file using *csv\_output*.

## NOTES

The aim of this module is to provide diagnostics to the user about the
size of detectable "objects" in an image. This can provide helpful input
to modules that take a window size or desired object size as input, such
as, for example,
[r.texture](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.texture.html)
and
[i.segment](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.segment.html).

As Woodcock and Strahler (1980) write: "The reasoning behind this
measure is as follows. If the spatial resolution is considerably finer
than the objects in the scene, most of the measurements in the image
will be highly correlated with their neighbors and a measure of local
variance will be low. If the objects approximate the size of the
resolution cells, then the likelihood of neighbors being similar
decreases and the local variance rises. As the size of the resolution
cells increase and many objects are found in a single resolution cell,
the local variance decreases."

## EXAMPLE

The three examples based on the North Carolina demo data orthophoto show
how different types of objects in images lead to different forms of the
variance curve with different resolutions showing peak values of
variance.

Image of region 1 and plot of variance against resolution.  
The highest peak at ca. 15m corresponds to the average distance between
fairways. Local maxima between 40m and 50m correspond to the average
width of fairways.

### Region 2

The abundance of small objects leads to a peak close to the 1m original
resolution. The plateau between 5m and 10m corresponds to the houses.
Local maxima between 30m and 50m seem to correspond to the larger houses
and higher vegetation areas.

### Region 3
