## DESCRIPTION

*i.wavelet* Decomposes the time-series with the requested wavelet. The
output will have 4 components, High-Pass Level 1 and 2, Low-Pass Level 1
and 2. Low Pass Level 1 can be recomposed using HP2 and LP2 using the
recomposition mode.  
This module is designed to make a temporal fusion from multi-sources.

## NOTES

## TODO

More wavelet families to be included.
