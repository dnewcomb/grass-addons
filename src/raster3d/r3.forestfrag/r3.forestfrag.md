## DESCRIPTION

TODO: Create a description specific for 3D version *r.forestfrag*
Computes the forest fragmentation following the methodology proposed by
Riitters et. al (2000). See [this
article](http://www.consecol.org/vol4/iss2/art3/) for a detailed
explanation.

It follows a "sliding window" algorithm with overlapping windows. The
amount of forest and its occurence as adjacent forest pixels within
fixed- area "moving-windows" surrounding each forest pixel is measured.
The window size is user-defined. The result is stored at the location of
the center pixel. Thus, a pixel value in the derived map refers to
"between-pixel" fragmentation around the corresponding forest location.

As input it requires a binary map with (1) forest and (0) non-forest.
Obviously, one can replace forest any other land cover type. If one
wants to exclude the influence of a specific land cover type, e.g.,
water bodies, it should be classified as no-data (NA) in the input map.
See e.g., [blog
post](https://pvanb.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/update-of-r-forestfrag-addon/).

Let *Pf* be the proportion of pixels in the window that are forested.
Define *Pff* (strictly) as the proportion of all adjacent (cardinal
directions only) pixel pairs that include at least one forest pixel, for
which both pixels are forested. *Pff* thus (roughly) estimates the
conditional probability that, given a pixel of forest, its neighbor is
also forest. The classification model then identifies six fragmentation
categories as:

```sh
interior:       Pf = 1.0
patch:          Pf < 0.4
transitional:   0.4 ≤ Pf < 0.6
edge:           Pf ≥ 0.6 and Pf - Pff < 0
perforated:     Pf ≥ 0.6 and Pf - Pff > 0
undetermined:   Pf ≥ 0.6 and Pf = Pff
```

## NOTES

- The moving window size is user-defined (default=3) and must be an
    odd number. If an even number is given the function will stop with
    an error message.
- No-data cells are ignored. This means that statistics at the raster
    edges are based on fewer cells (smaller) moving windows. If this is
    a problem, the user can choose to have the output raster trimmed
    with a number of raster cells equal to 1/2 \* the size of the moving
    window.
- The function respects the region. The user has however the option to
    set the region to match the input layer.
