## DESCRIPTION

*r3.count.categories* iterates over whole numbers (categories, classes)
in the 3D raster (considers values to be integers) and for each vertical
column counts them in the given column.

The 3D raster map is considered to be integer, i.e. all values are
converted to integer values with truncation. When some conversion is
appropriate the **multiply** option can be used to scale the value
before conversion. For example, if the values are percentages with
values between 0 and 1, value 100 can be used to obtain percentages
between 0 and 100. The values will be then preserved with precision 1
(decimal part is truncated).
