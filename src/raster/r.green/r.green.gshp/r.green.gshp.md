# Toolset for Computing the Ground Source Heat Pump

## DESCRIPTION

The *r.green.gshp* suite computes the Ground Source Heat Pump
potential.  
It is composed of several programs considering different limits (e.g.
theoretical, planning, technical, economic/financial constraints).

The development of this tool was funded by the Alpine Space
[GRETA](http://www.alpine-space.eu/projects/greta/en/home) project.  
[![image-alt](https://greta.eurac.edu/static/geonode/img/greta_logo.png)](https://www.alpine-space.eu/projects/greta/en/home)  
GRETA is co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund through
the [Interreg Alpine Space](https://www.alpine-space.eu/) programme.  
  
The *r.green.gshp* suite consists of the following different parts:  
  
- [r.green.gshp.theoretical](r.green.gshp.theoretical.md) - Calculates
    for each single Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE) the maximum
    power/energy potential, assessed through the G.POT method.
