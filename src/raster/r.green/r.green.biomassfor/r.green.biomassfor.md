# Toolset for Computing the Energy Potential of Biomass

## DESCRIPTION

The *r.green.biomassfor* suite computes the energy potential of biomass
from the forestry residues, considering different limits and constraints
(e.g. legal, technical, economic).

The *r.green.biomassfor* suite consists of the following different
parts:  
  
- [r.green.biomassfor](r.green.biomassfor.md) - computes the energy
    potential of biomass from the forestry residues, considering
    different limits and constraints (e.g. legal, technical, economic).
- [r.green.biomassfor.theoretical](r.green.biomassfor.theoretical.md)
  - Estimates potential bioenergy depending on forest increment,
    forest management and forest treatment
- [r.green.biomassfor.legal](r.green.biomassfor.legal.md) - Estimates
    potential bioenergy depending on forest increment, forest management
    and forest treatment
- [r.green.biomassfor.technical](r.green.biomassfor.technical.md) -
    Estimates the quantity of woody biomass obtained from a forest
    surface where extraction is possible given a particular level of
    mechanisation
- [r.green.biomassfor.financial](r.green.biomassfor.financial.md) -
    Estimates bioenergy that can be collected to supply heating plants
    or biomass logistic centres and that is associated with a positive
    net revenue for the entire production process
- [r.green.biomassfor.recommended](r.green.biomassfor.recommended.md)
  - Estimates potential bioenergy according to environmental
    restriction
- [r.green.biomassfor.impact](r.green.biomassfor.impact.md) -
    Calculates impact and multifunctionality values
