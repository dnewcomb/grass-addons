## DESCRIPTION

Compute the legal biomass forestry residual potential, based on the
annual/periodic forest yield.

## NOTES

This module permits to evalute the maximum bio-energy from forest
residual available in a particular area, on the base of the prescribed
yield. The mandatory data input are a vector file with fields with
values of yield, management, treatment, and forest surface. The yield
value is expressed in cubic meters, the forest surface in hectares, the
management is an integer value that can be 1 for high forest and 2 for
coppice, the treatment is an integer field that can be 1 for final
felling and 2 for thinning. The energy section contains the calorific
parameters that permits to convert the biomass in energy. The output
maps are expressed in Mwh.

## EXAMPLE

This example shows a typical input vector file with a table composed by
fields of increment, forest surface, management and treatment. This
example is based on data of Ma√® Valley, one of the test area of the
R.green project

The output map is a standardize energy map with the pixel value equal to
the corresponding bioenergy stimated.
