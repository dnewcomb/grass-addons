<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
The module r.stone is a GRASS implementation of the model STONE [1] for
three-dimensional modeling of rockfall trajectories. A rockfall is a point-like
block, by assumption, and the model simulates its trajectory as a sequence of
falling, bouncing and rolling steps. The trajectory follows a digital elevation
model, it starts from a user-defined source point(s) with a non-null initial
velocity and stops downhill when all of its kinetic energy is loss (i.e., when
it reaches a minimum velocity) by bouncing and/or rolling on the ground.
The Coefficients of normal and tangential restitution describe the amount
of kinetic energy lost in each bounce, and a friction coefficient describes
the kinetic energy loss during rolling. The r.stone implementation of STONE
requires a minimal set of input raster maps in addition to the DTM, including
a map of sources, and three maps of numerical coefficients. The output is a
raster map with values corresponding to the number of trajectories crossing
each grid cell after a full simulation.
</p>

<p>
Input DTM is a square fixed spaced DTM, used as a triangular regular network
built on the fly at run-time. Rockfall trajectories are evaluated using
parametric second-order equations after a roto-transformation of the coordinate
system to the run-time triangle. The calculation of each trajectory includes
the random selection of an initial direction angle, and of cell-by-cell values
of restitution and friction coefficients extracted from Gaussian distributions
centered on the values specified in the corresponding input raster and limited
by +/- 10% from the central value. By virtue of the random selection of initial
angle and parameters, and of the possibility of simulating many trajectories
from each source cell, the output assumes a probabilistic meaning.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>The input parameters of r.stone listed below are all mandatory. Generating a
map of source locations requires either knowledge of the area, gained through
field campaigns or aerial photos, or a sound statistical method. A simplistic
method to estimate the location of sources is to consider locations on steep
terrain as possible rockfall sources, for example:</p>

<pre><code>bash
g.region rast=dem
r.slope.aspect –e elevation=dem slope=slope
r.mapcalc “sources = if(slope&gt;50,10,null())”
</code></pre>

<p>to simulate 10 trajectories originating from each cell with slope larger
  than 50 degrees.</p>

<p>Raster maps of friction and restitution coefficients can be generated based
on geo-lithological knowledge of the area. Assuming a geological map, in
polygonal vector format, with classes similar to the table below, we generate
the input raster maps as follows:</p>

<pre><code>bash
v.db.addcolumn map=geology columns='friction real, nrest integer, vrest integer'
db.execute sql=”update geology set friction=0.65 where class_id=1”
db.execute sql=”update geology set friction=0.80 where class_id=2”
...
v.to.rast input=geology use=attr attribute_column=friction output=friction
</code></pre>

<p>And similar operations for nrest and vrest, for all classes present in the
  geology map. The actual model run is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>bash
r.stone dem=dem sources=sources_raster nrest=nrest_raster
        trest=trest_raster friction=friction_raster stop_vel=1
        counter=out_counter_raster
</code></pre>


<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>dem</strong> is the input digital elevation model.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>sources</strong> is the input sources raster.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Defines the start and stop points of the rockfalls trajectories.
        Positive integer values indicate source areas, while a value of -1
        indicates areas where rocks must stop, such as for example a lake.
        Values larger than 1
        trigger the simulation of a corresponding number of randomized
        trajectories,
        from the same starting point. Null cells have no effect.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>nrest</strong> is the normal restitution raster map.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Contains values of normal (vertical) restitution coefficient, useful at
        impact points. Accepted values are from 0 (total energy dumping) to 100
        (elastic restitution). Values are expressed in integer percentage.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>trest</strong> is the tangential restitution raster map.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Contains values of tangential (horizontal) restitution coefficient,
        used
        at impact points. Accepted values are from 0 (total energy dumping)
        to 100
        (elastic restitution). Values are expressed in integer percentage.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>friction</strong> is the Friction raster map.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Contains values of the rolling friction angle (tan(beta)).
        <ul>
          <li>Example Frictions:</li>
          <li>For alluvial deposits, where the friction is high: beta = 40.4,
            tan(beta) = 0.85</li>
          <li>For bedrock, where the friction is low: beta = 16.7,
            tan(beta) = 0.30</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>stop_vel</strong> is the parameter used to define the
    minimum velocity for a rock to
    be considered in motion. A velocity lower than
    the one specified here causes
    the boulder to stop.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>counter</strong> is the output raster of the
    number of stones that passed through
    a cell.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The following table, extracted from [1], gives example values of restitution
and friction coefficients corresponding to 19
lithological classes used in Italy.

<h3>Sample output</h3>

A sample portion of a 10m x 10m resolution DEM, with one grid cell (red square)
acting as a rockfall source point, with raster value 100: the effect on the
model r.stone is to simulate 100 trajectories starting from that cell.
