<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Module <em>r.niche.similarity</em> computes two metrics to quantify niche
similarity or overlap between all pairs of input raster layers.

<p>
One is the niche equivalency or similarity for two species following Warren et
al. (2008) based on Schoeners D (Schoener, 1968). This metric ranges from 0 to
1, representing respectively no overlap and an identical distribution.

<p>
The other is the niche overlap metric which indicates the niche overlap from
predictions of species distributions with the I similarity statistic of Warren
et al. (2009), which is based on Hellinger Distances (van der Vaart, 1998). The
statistic ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (the distributions are identical).

<p>
By default the results are written to screen, but they can also be written to a
text file with two columns for the names of each pair of rasters, a third column
for the type of statistic (D or I) and a fourth column for the D or I statistic.

<h2>Notes</h2>

This implementation is especially suitable if you are working with very large
data sets. Results were checked against the nicheOverlap function in the dismo
package for R.

<p>
If any of the input maps include NODATA cells, these should normally not be
included. To ensure this, the <b>-m</b> flag can be set to remove them. This
mimics the default behaviour of the <a
href="https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/dismo/html/nicheOverlap.html">nicheOverlap</a>
function in the R dismo package. Depending on what the NODATA represents, an
alternative approcah is to replace the NODATA with 0 values before running
<em>r.niche.overlap</em>.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Create two random rasters

<div class="code"><pre>
# Set region
g.region rows=18 cols=36 w=10 s=10 res=0.1

# Create rasters r1 and r2
r.mapcalc 'r1 = rand(0.0,1.0)' seed=0
r.mapcalc 'r1 = rand(0.0,1.0)' seed=1
</pre></div>

Compute the I and D

<div class="code"><pre>
# Create rasters r1 and r2
r.niche.similarity -i -d maps=r1,r2
</pre></div>
