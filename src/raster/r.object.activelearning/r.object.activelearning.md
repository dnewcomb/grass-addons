## DESCRIPTION

This module uses SVM from the *scikit-learn* python package to perform
classification on regions of raster maps. These regions can be the
output of
*[i.segment](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/i.segment.html)*
or
*[r.clump](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.clump.html)*.

The module enables learning with only a small initial labeled data set
via *active learning*. This semi-supervised learning algorithm
interactively query the user to label the regions that are most useful
to improve the overall classification score. With this technique, the
number of examples to learn the classification is often much lower than
the number of examples needed in normal supervised algorithms. You
should start the classification with a small training set and run the
module multiple times to label new informative samples to improve the
classification score. The score metric is the number of correctly
predicted labels over the total number of samples in the test set.

The samples that are chosen to be labeled are the ones where the class
prediction is the most uncertain \[2\]. Moreover, from the more
uncertain samples, only the most different samples are kept \[1\]. This
diversity heuristic takes into account for each uncertain sample the
distance to its closest neighbour and the average distance to all other
samples. This ensures that newly labeled samples are not redundant with
each other.

The learning data should be composed of features extracted from the
regions, for example with the *[i.segment.stats](i.segment.stats.md)*
module. The features of the training set, the test set and the unlabeled
set should be in three different files in csv format. The first line of
each file must be a header containing the features' name. Every regions
should be uniquely identified by the first attribute. The classes for
the training and test examples should be the second attribute.

Example of a training and test files :

```csv
cat,Class_num,attr1,attr2,attr3
167485,4,3.546,456.76,6.76
183234,6,5.76,1285.54,9.45
173457,2,5.65,468.76,6.78
```

Example of an unlabeled file :

```csv
cat,attr1,attr2,attr3
167485,3.546,456.76,6.76
183234,5.76,1285.54,9.45
173457,5.65,468.76,6.78
```

The training set can be easily updated once you have labeled new
samples. Create a file to specify what label you give to which sample.
This file in csv format should have a header and two attributes per line
: the ID of the sample you have labeled and the label itself. The module
will transfer the newly labeled samples from the unlabeled set to the
training set, adding the class you have provided. This is done
internally and does not modify your original files.

If the user wants to save the changes in new files according to the
updates, new files can be created with the new labeled samples added to
the training file and removed from the unlabeled file. Just specify the
path of those output files in the parameters (training\_updated,
unlabeled\_updated).

Example of an update file :

```csv
cat,Class_num
194762,2
153659,6
178350,2
```

Here are more details on a few parameters :

- **learning\_steps** : This is the number of samples that the module
    will ask to label at each run.
- **nbr\_uncertainty** : Number of uncertain samples to choose before
    applying the diversity filter. This number should be higher than
    *learning\_steps*
- **diversity\_lambda** : Parameter used in the diversity heuristic.
    If close to 0 only take into account the average distance to all
    other samples. If close to 1 only take into account the distance to
    the closest neighbour
- **c\_SVM** : Penalty parameter C of the error term. If it is too
    large there is a risk of overfitting the training data. If it is too
    small you may have underfitting.
- **gamma\_SVM** : Kernel coefficient. 1/\#features is often a good
    value to start with.
- **search\_iter** :Number of parameter settings that are sampled in
    the automatic parameter search (C, gamma). search\_iter trades off
    runtime vs quality of the solution.

### With an update file

The five samples output at the previous example have been labeled and
added to the update file.

```sh
        r.object.activelearning training_set=/path/to/training_set.csv \
                                test_set=/path/to/test_set.csv \
                    unlabeled_set=/path/to/unlabeled_set.csv \

## NOTES

This module requires the *scikit-learn* python package. This module
needs to be installed in your GRASS GIS Python environment. Please refer
to [*r.learn.ml*](r.learn.ml.html)'s notes on how to install this
package.

The memory usage for \~1450 samples of 52 features each is around \~650
kb. This number can vary due to the unpredictablity of the garbage
collector's behaviour. Everything is computed in memory; therefore the
size of the data is limited by the amount of RAM available.
