## DESCRIPTION

This submodule - *r.agent.rand* - is nothing but an example of how the
*libagent* library might be used to get a simple setup running.

## NOTES

As the name suggests, *r.agent.rand* lets agents wander around just
based on chance. You only need to define a single input map, just some
raster map, that will be completely ignored, it is only used to set the
frame for the agents to come.
