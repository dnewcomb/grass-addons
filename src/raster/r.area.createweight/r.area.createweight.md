## DESCRIPTION

*r.area.createweight* can be used to create a *weighting layer* for
*[dasymetric mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasymetric_map)*
using a Random Forest model. Dasymetric mapping is used to redistribute
a response variable (e.g. population count) mapped at a coarse spatial
unit level (e.g. administrative units), into a raster grid with a finer
spatial resolution. Based on a vector layer with the response variable
stored in the attribute table and a raster map with categorical values
(e.g. land cover), the add-on will produce a raster with the weights to
be used in a dasymetric mapping operation that can be performed using
*[v.area.weigh](v.area.weigh.md)*.

*r.area.createweight* also creates a 'gridded' version of the spatial
units, whose borders will appear as staircases following the spatial
resolution of the weighting layer produced. These two outputs can be
used in *[v.area.weigh](v.area.weigh.md)* module.

A Random Forest (RF) regression model is trained at the level of the
vector spatial units. The user must specify a vector layer using the
**vector** parameter. The attribute table connected to this layer must
contain a column with a unique identifier (numeric), specified via the
**id** parameter. It must also contain a column with the numeric value
to be used as the response variable (e.g. population count), specified
via the **response\_variable** parameter.

The user must specify at least one categorical raster map,
**basemap\_a**. Optionally, other variables can be added to the Random
Forest model: A second categorical raster map can be defined with the
parameter **basemap\_b**, and/or a raster with continuous values (e.g.
distance to the nearest road, school, hospital, university...) with the
parameter **distance\_to**. From these raster maps, the Random Forest's
explanatory variables (i.e. covariates, predictors) are calculated. For
each of the categorical raster maps (basemaps), the proportion of each
class is calculated. For the continuous raster map, the average values
are calculated.

Once trained, the Random Forest model predicts weights in a raster grid.
The spatial resolution of this output weighted grid should be specified
via the **tile\_size** parameter, and its name via the **output**
parameter. The **tile\_size** must be greater than the spatial
resolution of **basemap\_a**. It is considered good practice that the
**tile\_size** also be greater than the spatial resolution of the other
basemap and distance maps. The extent of the output weighted grid is
created using the extent of the spatial units, i.e. the **vector**
parameter.

By default, all classes from the raster basemap(s) are taken into
account. If the user wants only specific classes to be taken into
account within the Random Forest model, it is possible to provide an
optional list of these classes with the **basemap\_a\_list** parameter
(for basemap\_a) or the **basemap\_b\_list** parameter (for basemap\_b,
if used).

The out-of-bag error (OOB) of the model is printed in the console and
gives an indication about the internal accuracy of the model
(cross-validation on training set at the spatial units level). The log
of the Random Forest run (including the OOB error) is saved in a file
which path and name has to be specified via the **log\_file** parameter.
Using the **-f** flag, the log file will include extended information
about the cross-validation for each set of parameters tested in the grid
search.

Feature importances in the model are plotted in a graph, which path and
name has to be specified via the **plot** parameter. By default, class
values are used. Optionally, class labels can be used as plot labels,
using the flags **-a** and **-b**, for **basemap\_a** and **basemap\_b**
respectively. If these flags are used, the raster should already contain
the associated category labels. The module
[r.category](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.category.html)
can be used to set category labels for a raster map. If the flag(s)
**-a** and/or **-b** is(are) selected without existing categories for
the corresponding raster map, the class value will be kept.

Parallel processing is supported. The number of cores to be used should
be specified via the **n\_jobs** parameter.

The addon is described in more details in a paper \[3\] with a case
study.

## NOTES

The module
[r.mask](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/r.mask.html) is
used within *r.area.createweight*. The user should first remove any
masks.

It is good practice that the spatial units (**vector** parameter) are
*entirely* spatially covered by *all* the input rasters. Any spatial
units not sufficiently covered by *all* the input rasters should first
be removed by the user, prior to run *r.area.createweight*. The add-on,
however, will function even if the spatial units are not completely
covered by the input rasters. This allows for occasionally missing
pixels, or a non-perfect alignment of input rasters with the spatial
units (i.e. NULL values in the rasters). In the example below, numerous
spatial units are not sufficiently covered, and should be removed prior
to running the add-on. It is up to the users to choose an acceptable
level of coverage for their analysis, and to ensure the quality of the
input data, keeping in mind that the higher the coverage, the better the
RF model. The RF model and its prediction will only be as good as the
input data it is given.

![image-alt](r_area_createweight_overlap_admin.png)  
*Only the spatial units in grey are completely spatially covered by
the basemap and are the ideal selection for the analysis.*

If a cell of the weighted grid (**output** parameter) is not covered by
*all* the input rasters (i.e. if the statistics calculated for that cell
are null for at least one of the input rasters), the cell will be given
a nodata value.

The module makes a temporary copy of the categorical input rasters
(**basemap\_a** and **basemap\_b**) clipped to the area covered by the
spatial units. This allows for the extraction of raster categories that
exist only within the spatial units. If a user specifies a list of
raster categories (**basemap\_a\_list** or **basemap\_b\_list**), these
classes must be present in the area covered by the spatial units. The
distance map (**distance\_to**) is not changed, and it is kept in its
original format.

The spatial units are rasterised to the extent, cell size and alignment
of the output weighted grid, and then are re-vectorised. This results in
spatial units whose boundaries will have a 'staircase' appearance, and
ensures that each tile of the output weighted grid will be contained in
only one spatial unit. This 'gridded' version of the spatial units can
be used as an input for dasymetric mapping with
[v.area.weigh](v.area.weigh.md). However, if the original vector
contains small (or very narrow) polygons, and the desired tile-size is
too large, some polygons can disappear during this process. This will
produce an error. The user should reduce the tile size, and/or edit the
spatial units vector to merge the smallest spatial units with their
neighbouring units (see examples).

The response variable is log-transformed to avoid non-normal
distribution and used to train the model. The prediction is then
back-transformed and stored in the final weight raster. This approach is
similar to the one proposed by \[1\]. Because of this log transformation
(Napierian logarithm), it is mandatory to not have zero or negative
values in the column containing the response variable
(**response\_variable** parameter). It is also expected that the
response variable column does not contain *NULL* values. For the same
reason, the model is unable to predict a zero weight value. The
implementation of the add-on is designed to set a value of 0 in the
weighting layer if the predicted weight is smaller than 0.0000000001
obs./mÂ².

The covariates whose feature importance is below 0.5% are, by default,
removed from the final model. The **-a** flag can be used to force
keeping all the covariates in the final model.

The parameters of the Random Forest model are tuned using grid search
and cross-validation. By default, a 5-fold cross-validation scheme is
used but the user can change the number of folds using the **kfold**
parameter. Optionally, the user can provide a Python dictionary with the
parameters to be tested via the **param\_grid** parameter. For
information about the parameters to be used, please refer to the
*[scikit-learn
manual](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html)*.
An example of the format is as follows, these are the parameters tested
in the add-on:

```python
"{'oob_score':[True],'bootstrap':[True],\
  'max_features':['sqrt',0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,1],\
  'n_estimators':[500,1000]}"
```

### GRASS GIS addons

*r.area.createweight* requires the GRASS GIS addons
[i.segment.stats](i.segment.stats.md),
[r.zonal.classes](r.zonal.classes.md), and [r.clip](r.clip.md) to be
installed. This can be done using
[g.extension](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/g.extension.html).

### Python libraries

*r.area.createweight* uses the **"scikit-learn"** machine learning
package (version \>= 0.24.1) along with the **"pandas"** Python package
(version \>= 1.0.1). These packages need to be installed within your
GRASS GIS Python environment for *r.area.createweight* to work, i.e.
using the GRASS command line terminal for installation.  
For **Linux** users, this package should be available through the Linux
package manager in most distributions (named for example
"python3-scikit-learn").  
For **MS-Windows** users using a 64 bit GRASS, the easiest way is to use
the [OSGeo4W](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/ms-windows/)
installation method of GRASS, where the Python setuptools can also be
installed. The users can then run `easy_install pip` to install the pip
package manager. Then, they can download the "Python wheels"
corresponding to each package and install them using the following
command: `pip install packagename.whl`. Links for downloading wheels are
provided below. The version installed should be compatible with the
user's Python version. If GRASS was not installed using the OSGeo4W
method, the pip package manager can be installed by saving the
"get-pip.py" python script provided
[here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) in the folder containing
the GRASS GIS Python environment (GRASSFOLDER/../etc/python/grass) and
executing it with administrator rights with the following command:
`python get-pip.py`  
For users of **macOS** GRASS-X.X.app bundles, start GRASS and install
packages with following commands in the Terminal: `python -m pip install
--upgrade pip` and `python -m pip install pandas scikit-learn`.

## EXAMPLES

Here we use the GRASS GIS sample North Carolina data set to create a
weighting layer of population, using the layers **basemap\_a** =
*landuse96\_28m* and **vector** spatial units = *censusblk\_swwake*. A
**distance** map can be created from the *streets\_wake* layer. Some of
the layers must first be prepared as follows.

### Dataset preparation of North Carolina data layers

#### Prepare distance layer

A layer containing distance to the nearest street can be created as
follows:

Set region

```sh
g.region raster=landuse96_28m
```

Rasterize streets

```sh
v.to.rast input=streets_wake type=line output=streets_wake_rast \
  use=attr attribute_column=F_NODE
```

Create distance to streets map

```sh
r.grow.distance input=streets_wake_rast \
  distance=distance_streets
```

Remove unnecessary files

```sh
g.remove -f type=raster name=streets_wake_rast
```

![Distance to streets layer](r_area_createweight_distance_streets.png)  
*Distance to streets layer*

#### Prepare spatial units layer

The vector spatial units layer must be prepared prior to running the
module, as there are many small spatial units (polygons) that will get
lost during rasterization, and some of the spatial units have a value of
zero in the column *TOTAL\_POP*, i.e. the column containing the response
variable. In this case, both are solved by merging the smaller spatial
units with their neighbouring units, as follows:

Set region

```sh
g.region vector=censusblk_swwake
```

Create a vector of points with the centroids of all polygons in the
initial census file

```sh
v.to.points input=censusblk_swwake type=centroid,face \
  output=censusblk_swwake_points
```

Merge polygons to create larger spatial zones

```sh
v.clean input=censusblk_swwake output=censusblk_swwake_merge \
  tool=rmarea threshold=1060000
```

Drop attribute table and connection to layer for merged vector

```sh
db.droptable -f table=censusblk_swwake_merge
v.db.connect -d map=censusblk_swwake_merge
```

Add new attribute table to merged vector

```sh
v.db.addtable map=censusblk_swwake_merge \
  columns="id integer"
```

Populate attribute table with id and population data (using
*v.vect.stats* to sum up population values)

```sh
v.what.vect map=censusblk_swwake_merge column=id \
  query_map=censusblk_swwake_points  \
  query_column=OBJECTID
v.vect.stats points=censusblk_swwake_points \
  areas=censusblk_swwake_merge method=sum points_column=TOTAL_POP \
  count_column=count stats_column=pop
```

Remove spatial units not completely covered by all input rasters (as
spatial units should ideally be completely spatially covered).

```sh
v.extract -r input=censusblk_swwake_merge \
  cats='32,552,494,479,483,604,515,553,724,621,700,956,1500,1819,1597, \
  2190,2239,2263,2360,2483,2514,2507,2433,2503,2466,2513,471,472,469, \
  461,448,388,253,204,145,43,33' output=censusblk_swwake_final
```

Remove unnecessary files

```sh
g.remove -f type=vector \
  name=censusblk_swwake_points,censusblk_swwake_merge
```

### Create weighted layer

Generate a weighting layer using a land use map

```sh
r.area.createweight vector=censusblk_swwake_final id=cat \
  response_variable=pop basemap_a=landuse96_28m tile_size=100 \
  output_weight=weighted_layer output_units=gridded_spatial_units \
  plot=path/to/filename log_file=path/to/filename n_jobs=4
  
```

Generate a weighting layer using only certain classes of the land use
map

```sh
r.area.createweight vector=censusblk_swwake_final id=cat \
  response_variable=pop basemap_a=landuse96_28m tile_size=100 \
  output_weight=weighted_layer output_units=gridded_spatial_units \
  plot=path/to/filename log_file=path/to/filename \
  basemap_a_list=1,2,4 n_jobs=4
```

Generate a weighting layer using land use map, distance map and
associated class names for feature importance plot

```sh
r.area.createweight -a vector=censusblk_swwake_final id=cat \
  response_variable=pop basemap_a=landuse96_28m \
  distance_to=distance_streets tile_size=100 \
  output_weight=weighted_layer output_units=gridded_spatial_units \
  plot=path/to/filename log_file=path/to/filename n_jobs=4
```
