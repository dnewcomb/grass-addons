## DESCRIPTION

*r.flowfill* runs the FlowFill code (Callaghan and Wickert, 2019) that
moves water cell-by-cell to flood depressions in a DEM. It can be used
as a simplified/cellular simulation of downslope flow (though not
equivalent to physics-based approaches for flow) or as a tool to fill
depressions in a DEM. For further information, see the README at
<https://github.com/KCallaghan/FlowFill>.
