## DESCRIPTION

*v.stream.profiler* builds and exports plots and data sets of river long
profiles, slope-accumulation (e.g., slope-area), and more for
topographic analysis. It currently works only in a downstream-directed
walk, for a single channel, from the chosen segment until the
downstream-most point in the network. It takes in the adjacency
structure supplied by [v.stream.network](v.stream.network).
